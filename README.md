# LSWT-prediction
LSWT prediction
This code enables the prediction of Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) based on the BO-NARX-BR model. 
It encompasses a neural network, the nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX), 
optimized using the Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm to determine the optimal number of hidden nodes, lags, and delays. 
The network is trained using the Bayesian Regression backpropagation algorithm to optimize weights and biases.
